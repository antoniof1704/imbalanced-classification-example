# Imbalanced Classification Example

This repository contains part of the code I used for a project aimed at building a model with data containing an imbalanced class. Despite the class imbalance, I followed an iterative approach to model development, starting with a simple decision tree model and progressively testing and refining various modeling techniques. The final model I selected was based on SMOTE, and I saved the model weights in a .pkl file.

## Credit Card Fraud Dataset (from Kaggle)

Due to GDPR and data governance protocols, I am unable to share the original dataset used in this project. However, to ensure that the code is runnable, Iâ€™ve imported a widely used synthetic dataset containing fake credit card fraud data (with an imbalanced class) from Kaggle.
